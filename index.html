            Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently a student
            pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Utah Tech
            University. I have lived in St. George, Utah my whole life and spend
            my free time snowboarding, hiking, and watching youbtube videos that
            teach me something. I have always been fascinated by technology and
            how it shapes our world.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a software engineering student, I have honed my skills in various
            programming languages such as Javascript, C++, C, HTML, CSS, SQL,
            Python. I am proud to say that I have maintained an above 3.9 major
            GPA throughout my Software Engineering degree, demonstrating my
            commitment to excellence and dedication to my studies.I am
            passionate about creating innovative solutions to complex problems
            and always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies
            and trends.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to work on
            various projects that have challenged me both technically and
            creatively. As a team leader, I have learned the importance of
            effective communication, collaboration, and delegation to ensure
            project success. I believe that my ability to work well in a team
            setting, coupled with my problem-solving skills, makes me an asset
            to any project or organization. This portfolio website is a showcase
            of my skills, achievements, and projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope to demonstrate my proficiency in software development and
            illustrate my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Thank you
            for taking the time to learn about me, and I look forward to
            connecting with you soon!
          </p>
